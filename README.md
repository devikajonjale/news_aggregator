# News Aggregator Web App
**This Web application is a combination of web crawlers and web applications. It scrapes news articles from the website theonion.com and present it in a webpage.**

This project works in 3 steps:
- It scrapes the web for the articles. (Here, we are scraping a website called theonion)
- Then it stores the articleâ€™s images, links, and title.
- The stored objects in the database are served to the client. The client gets information in a nice template.

**This is a practice project made from the DataFlair Project Tutorial:** https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-project-news-aggregator-app/
